# Utilities

A small collection of some of the utilities I've built over time for my own use or for others, to automate specific tasks, or for fun or to satisfy a curiosity, isolated so as to be more generally useful. A few were written for demonstrative purposes, while tutoring. Some need some work to be more consistently or widely useful, and I'll add updates and fixes, and more utilities.
